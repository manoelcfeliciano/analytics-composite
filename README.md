## üöÄ Technologies

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
-   [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
-   [Intercom Client](https://github.com/intercom/intercom-node)

## üìú About the Project

The main goal here is to demonstrate how to solve a real world problem of needing to log a purchase
event to multiple external services (\*) in a scalable and maintainable way. For that, this project
used a well-known design pattern called
Composite[https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite].

In other to persist data in Intercom, of course you would need an Intercom API Key, defined in a
`.env` file (example in `.env.example`).

(\*) For simplicity purposes, only one external service (Intercom) is implemented in this project.
To add new providers you just need to create a class that complies to the interface
LogAnalyticsPurchase.

## üèÅ How to Run

If you are going to use Docker it is as simple as running the following command:

```
docker-compose-up
```

If you are going to run the project without Docker, follow the steps bellow:

1 - Install the project dependencies

```
yarn install
```

2 - Duplicate the .env.example file and rename it to .env

3 - Get the secret values with the Lead Developer and replace it in your .env

4 - Build the project

```
yarn build
```

5 - Run the project

Watch mode (auto restart on every file change)

```
yarn dev
```

Regular mode (need to restart manually if a file changes)

```
yarn build && yarn start
```

## üß™ How to Run the Tests

The are mainly two types of automated tests in the application: unit and integration. We have 5
different commands to run the tests depending on the developer needs:

1 - Runs the unit tests of the application.

```
yarn test:unit
```

2 - Runs the integration tests of the application.

```
yarn test:integration
```

3 - Run both the unit and the integration tests.

```
yarn test
```

4- Run both the unit and the integration tests, also generating a coverage report.

```
yarn test:ci
```

5 - Run both the unit and the integration tests but with greater logging information for debug
purposes.

```
yarn test:verbose
```
